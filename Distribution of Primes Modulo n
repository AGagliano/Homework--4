# The following gives the code for problem number 2, Distribution of Primes Modulo n
# This is known as Dirichlet's Theorem

n = 15
a = prime_range(10^7)
for i in range(0, len(a)):
    a[i] = a[i] % n

t = stats.TimeSeries(a)
t.plot_histogram()

#output:
histogram plot
patterns of histogram: the same counts of numbers result for 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14.
    This is a surprising result.

#Now using n = 3
histogram plot pattern: the same counts of numbers result for 1, 2.

#Using n = 31
histogram plot pattern: the same counts of numbers result for certain values between 1 and 30

#histogram for general n: same counts for numbers resulting for certain values between 1 and (n-1). 
    The pattern seems to go in a 2, 1, 2, 1, pattern where two integers side by side have counts in that category,
    skips an integer, then the next integer has high counts again, skips an integer, then the pattern repeats with 
    2 integers in a row with high counts. Quite interesting.
